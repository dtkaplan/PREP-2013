Investment returns are typically presented as multiplicative, in percent.  A common model of the uncertainty in a return in a Gaussian distribution, parameterized by the mean and the standard deviation.  The standard deviation reflects the uncertainty, the mean the typical return.

It's obvious that there should be a relationship between the mean return and the expectation value of the investment.  Less clear, is there a relationship between the standard deviation of the return and the expectation value of the investment.

Suppose the investment return over the period of interest has a mean return of $r$ and a standard deviation of $s$
