Functions Functions for Modeling
================================

General Features of Functions
-----------------------------
## What are the inputs?
Models should be intended for a purpose.  So it matters what is the input and what is the output, since you typically want to transform a particular quantity into another type of quantity.

## Difference between traditional math and computer notation for functions.
$y = mx + b$, $f(x) = mx + b$, $\int x dx$, $\sin(x)$, $\sqrt{x}$, and so on.

## Parameters.  
Why would we ever write $\sin x$?

Specific Functions for Modeling
-------------------------------

### Straight-Line functions $f(x) = mx + b$

#### Parameterization
Students already know a lot about these: slope and intercept.  Emphasize that these are parameters.  The parameters specify a particular function out of the whole set of functions.

Other parameterizations (e.g. point-slope, two-points, point-angle) can be converted to slope-intercept.

#### Applications
This is the general purpose modeling function.  All simple relationships can and are represented this way.
1. World record swim times versus year. ```swim100m.csv```
2. Wage versus education. ```cps.csv```
3. Natural gas usage versus temperature. ```utilities.csv```
See [more details on these examples](http://rpubs.com/dtkaplan/577)


### Exponentials 
#### Proportional versus constant change
1. Atmosphere pressure, water pressure
2. Population of Mexico (Math 135 27 Jan 2012)
3. Exponential models of data [Income and housing variables](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Exercises/HTML/AC-Income-and-Housing/AC-Income-and-Housing-A.html?access=AC7)

#### Parameterization of exponentials
1. Half-life, interest rate, exponential time constant.  Which is best depends on what information you have.
2. Conversion: Rule of 72.

#### Models
1. Half-lives of meds.  How often should you take the pill to keep the drug level within 10% over the long run?
2. [Activity on doubling and half-lives](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Math135/In-Class/doubling-activity.pdf) 
3. Sums of exponentials.  Why is cooling not a simple exponential?  [Fitting Stan's data](http://rpubs.com/dtkaplan/558) 

### Logarithms

#### Examples
1. [Happiness on a log scale](http://test.causeweb.org/wiki/mosaic/index.php/File:Happiness-and-log-scale.jpg) 
2. [Profanity and log axes](http://xkcd.com/798/)

#### Activities
1. Log axes --- how to interpret.  [Example of log axes](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Math135/In-Class/LogAxes.pdf). Activity: Plot intervals on these scale to indicate absolute and relative precision on both log and linear axes, for instance, 10% precision on measurements of 1 and of 100 on a log axis.

#### Modeling project
1. Prices versus log prices in the stock market.  Which generates a better simulation of stock variation: a random walk on $\Delta$ prices or a random walk on $\Delta$ log prices?

### Splines
1. Squeezing Orange Juice  

### Power Laws
1. Random walks.  How does the typical distance scale?  Explanation in terms of random vectors being perpendicular.  (Later application: Explaining the power law: integration of the square distance compared to integration of the absolute distance)
2. [Chest circumference versus weight](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/PREP2012/Primate-Body-Shape.pdf), [tree height and thickness](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/PREP2012/Tree-Strength.pdf).  (Later example in multivariate: [relationships in the internal combustion engine](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/PREP2012/engine-speed.pdf))

### Sines and Cosines

#### Parameterization
Amplitude, time lag, offset.

#### Models
1. Day length as a function of the day of the year.  (For later example, as a function of longitude.)  Where does the model break down (near the arctic circle)?
2. Tone and period.  Model a musical scale.  How does the period change from note to note?  Model a chord.
3. Modeling tide data.  Example on [Hawaiian tides](http://rpubs.com/dtkaplan/540)
4. Kepler and the planets.  (See ```kepler.Rnw```)
