Travel routes and the trade-off between time and distance
========================================================

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
require(mosaic, quietly=TRUE)
```

These are the data collected by the participants in 3 minutes from Google Maps, looking at various routes from Hesston College KS to Goshen College IN.  They entered distance (miles) and time (minutes longer than 14 hours) via a Google form.  The data were then downloaded from Google and are plotted here.

```{r}
routes = read.csv("Indiana-Kansas.csv")
plotPoints(Distance ~ Travel.Time, data=routes, pch=20,xlim=c(0,150),ylim=c(780,880))
```

Each dot is one possible route between Hesston and Goshen.

### QUESTIONS:
* Pick two different routes.  Which one is preferred in terms of time and in terms of distance?  
* Are there any pairs of routes where one is preferred in terms of time and the other in terms of distance?
* There's a diagonal streak in the middle of the graph.  Explain this.
