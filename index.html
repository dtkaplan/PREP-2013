<p>Modeling is an important mathematical skill, yet instructors are often at a loss about how to teach it.  This workshop will help you teach introductory calculus in a way that engages modeling skills.  Based on ideas and materials developed as part of the NSF-supported Project MOSAIC, the workshop will examine introductory calculus from two perspectives:
<ul>
  <li>motivating calculus topics through authentic modeling settings</li>
  <li>using modeling to reinforce learning about calculus topics</li>
</ul>
You will see traditional calculus topics (e.g., optimization, related rates) in a new light, as well as nontraditional topics (e.g. least squares, modeling-building heuristics) that use calculus to enhance modeling skills.  We will expore existing modeling case studies, and participants will be guided in developing a modeling case study of their own.</p>

<p>Organizers: Danny Kaplan (Macalester College), Randall Pruim (Smith College), Eric Marland (Appalachian State University), Karl-Dieter Chrisman (Gordon College) </p>

<p>Primary funding is provided by NSF DUE- 0920350.</p>
