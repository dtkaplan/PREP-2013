Latex vs. Rmd
======================

```{r include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
```

You'll use substantially the same structure to write a document usin
g markdown or $\LaTeX$, that is, with a `.Rmd` or `.Rnw` file type.

The style of the "chunk" differs, but the R commands are the same

```{r dev='svg',out.width='60%'}
f <- antiD( sin(3*x) ~ x )
plotFun(f(x)~x, x.lim=range(0,4) )
```   

Why would you want to use one versus the other?
* Latex compiles nicely to PDF, Rmd to HTML
* Rmd is easier to write and compile
