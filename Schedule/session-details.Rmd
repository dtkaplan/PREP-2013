### MAA PREP 2013 Workshop
### Modeling: Early and Often in Undergraduate Calculus


Session Details
================
## Session 0: Monday Dinner

### Welcome

### Introductions


* [Slides](../Intro/Intro.pdf)
* Participants' [Definitions of Calculus and Modeling](../SessionNotes/definitions.html)


## Session 1: Tuesday AM

### Software orientation

* Orientation to RStudio
* Getting Started with R
  * [The most important template in R](../RIntro/LearningTeachingR.html)
  * Calculus operations in the `mosaic` package. (*[Start R in Calculus](http://www.amazon.com/Start-Calculus-Daniel-T-Kaplan/dp/0983965897)*)
* Using R Markdown

### Mathematical functions for modeling
* Deliverable: Use RMarkdown to defend your choice of functions

### Fitting parameters
* Examples: [world population](../Notes/Functions/WorldPopulation.html), [tides](../Notes/Tides/tides-hawaii.html), [income and housing](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Exercises/HTML/AC-Income-and-Housing/AC-Income-and-Housing-A.html), [cooling water](../Notes/Cooling/CoolingCoffee.html)
   
## Session 2: Tuesday PM

### The process of modeling

* The process of modeling
* Group work on [model settings](model-settings.html)


## Session 3 Wednesday AM

### Review of functions and the modeling process

* Functions for a modeler's toolkit: constant, power-law, exponential, sine, bump, and S-functions.  Linear combinations.
* Constructing functions
    * linear & nonlinear fitting

### Derivatives and Anti-derivatives

General comments on [models, mathematics, and calculus](../Notes/Overviews/Modeling-and-Mathematics.html) and on [teaching derivatives and anti-derivatives](../Notes/Overviews/Derivatives.html)
* From a function to its derivatives: [HIV prevalence and incidence](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Math135/In-Class/hiv-graph.pdf); [economic production](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Math135/In-Class/cobb-douglas-partial-derivatives.pdf); [celebrity divorce](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Math135/In-Class/celebrity-divorce.pdf)
* From a derivative to a function: [distance travelled by a car](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Math135/In-Class/road-capacity-activity.pdf) and [traffic light capacity](../Notes/Integration/Traffic-Light-Capacity.html).  Some other [integration model settings](../Notes/Overviews/Integrals.html)


### Tools for modelers

* Residuals -- looking at the cooling water: `fetchData("PREP/water-cooling.csv")`
* [Functions in Two Variables](../Notes/TwoVariables/TwoVariablesIntro.html). Activity: [Drawing contours](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Math135/In-Class/hiv-graph.pdf)  Activity: the [ideal gas law](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Math135/In-Class/ideal-gas-activity1.pdf)
* Heuristics for polynomials [pdf](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5098197/Math135/In-Class/poly2d.pdf) and [comments to instructors](../Notes/Polynomials/notes-on-polynomials.html)
* Fitting and precision
* Units and dimensions


## Session 4 Wednesday PM

### Working with your current textbook

* Finding "drop-in" modeling activities
* Converting non-modeling activities to modeling activities
* Finding data 
    * [pouring orange juice](../Notes/OrangeJuiceFlow/OrangeJuice.html), cell telephone sensor data
    * The Island: Letting Students Experiment and College Data by Michael Bulmer [video](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/MCAST/videos/MCAST-2012-02-24/index.htm). This is a simulation of realistic demographics, disease, and physiology from which students can collect data for modeling.
* Some bogus models: [Snowy Tree crickets](../Notes/Functions/SnowTreeCricket.html) and [beach crowds](../Notes/Optimization/beach-population.html)

### Building a case study

* Learning objectives
* Mathematical objectives
* Participant presentations: Your modeling setting

## Session 5 Thursday AM

### Tools for Modelers

* Dynamics
* Optimization
    * [QALYs](http://prep2012.mosaic-web.org/Topics/Optimization/QALY1.html)

## Session 6 Thursday PM

* Building a modeling case study.
* Writing modeling projects and exercises


## Session 7 Friday AM
