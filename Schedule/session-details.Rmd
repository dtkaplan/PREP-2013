### MAA PREP 2013 Workshop
### Modeling: Early and Often in Undergraduate Calculus


Session Details
================
## Session 0: Monday Dinner

### Welcome

### Introductions

* [Slides](../Intro/Intro.pdf)

## Session 1: Tuesday AM

### Software orientation

* Orientation to RStudio
* Getting Started with R
  * [The most important template in R](../RIntro/LearningTeachingR.html)
  * Calculus operations in the `mosaic` package. (*[Start R in Calculus](http://www.amazon.com/Start-Calculus-Daniel-T-Kaplan/dp/0983965897)*)
* Using R Markdown

### Mathematical functions for modeling
* Deliverable: Use RMarkdown to defend your choice of functions

### Fitting parameters
* Examples: [world population](../Notes/Functions/WorldPopulation.html) [tides](../Notes/Tides/tides-hawaii.html), [income and housing](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5098197/Exercises/HTML/AC-Income-and-Housing/AC-Income-and-Housing-A.html), [cooling water](../Notes/Cooling/CoolingCoffee.html)
   
## Session 2: Tuesday PM

### The process of modeling

* The process of modeling
* Group work on [model settings](model-settings.html)
    
### Working with your current textbook


* Finding "drop-in" activities
* Converting non-modeling activities to modeling activities
* Finding data 
    * coffee and orange juice, prevalence and incidence
    * The Island: Letting Students Experiment and College Data by Michael Bulmer [video](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/MCAST/videos/MCAST-2012-02-24/index.htm). This is a simulation of realistic demographics, disease, and physiology from which students can collect data for modeling.
* Some bogus models: [Snowy Tree crickets](../Notes/Functions/SnowTreeCricket.html) and [beach crowds](../Notes/Optimization/beach-population.html)

### Finding data

* Some examples: coffee and orange juice, prevalence and incidence, your cell phone
* The Island: Letting Students Experiment and College Data by Michael Bulmer [video](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/MCAST/videos/MCAST-2012-02-24/index.htm). This is a simulation of realistic demographics, disease, and physiology from which students can collect data for modeling.
