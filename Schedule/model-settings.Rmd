Some Model Settings
============================

Working in groups, we want you to outline your proposed approach to at least three of these problems.

* Antibiotics (as introduced by Eric Marland)
* Being Warren Buffet
* What's a company's future profit flow worth today?  Netflix?  Apple?
* Steaming upriver
* Body shape and diabetes
* The shape of a tin can
* Volume and area of a lake: [map of Pokegama Lake in Minnesota](../Resources/Pokegama_Lake_measured.pdf)
* Fun on the Super Slide.
* Energy produced by an engine based on its configuration.  [Animation of a two-stroke engine](http://www.animatedengines.com/twostroke.html).  What are the important quantities?  How would you represent them to find energy?  (More engine animations [here](http://www.animatedengines.com/).)  It might be easiest to start with the [Newcomen engine](http://www.animatedengines.com/newcomen.html)
* Density of prime numbers. [Calculator for nearest primes](http://easycalculation.com/prime-number.php). Data for the number of primes less than $10^x$ for $x\leq 25$: [here](http://primes.utm.edu/howmany.shtml) which also has several approximate formulas for the density of prime numbers, e.g. $1/\ln(x)$ or $1/(\ln(x)-1)$.  See, e.g. SH Marshall and DR Smith (2013) "Feedback control and the distribution of prime numbers" *Mathematics Magazine, 86(30):189-203
